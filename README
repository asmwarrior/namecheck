1. INSTALLING NAMECHECK IN AN UBUNTU-BASED DISTRO
=================================================

Just run the ./installUbuntu script.


2. INSTALLING NAMECHECK IN A NON UBUNTU-BASED DISTRO
====================================================

If you don't have an Ubuntu-based distro, you'll have to
install the dependencies manually.
Feel free to contribute an installacion script for your
distro, by creating an issue in the Issue Tracker
(https://code.google.com/p/namecheck/issues/list),
attach the script, add instructions, and we will add it
to the repo.

The following libraries are needed to install namecheck:
    * Boost Regex: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html

    * Gcc Plugin Dev: find a package in your distro, it
      should look like gcc-4.x-plugin-dev (where 'x' is the
      minor version number of your gcc; type gcc --version
      in your terminal to get the number).

    * gettext: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
                    

3. BUILDING NAMECHECK
=====================

Once the dependencies are installed, just run make.


4. RUNNING NAMECHECK
====================

Namecheck can be used either as a static checker only (without
actually generating a binary of the source) or while
compiling (emitting warnings).

To use namecheck as a static checker only, you can invoke
gcc (or g++) like this:
    g++ -fplugin=/path/to/namecheck/libnamecheck.so -fplugin-arg-libnamecheck-path=/path/to/rules.cfg -c myfile.cpp -o /dev/null

To use namecheck while compiling, just remove the -c option:
    g++ -fplugin=/path/to/namecheck/libnamecheck.so -fplugin-arg-libnamecheck-path=/path/to/rules.cfg myfile.cpp -o myfile


5. COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
=========================

For a complete documentation, including how write your naming convention rules,
please visit the wiki sections of the home page (https://namecheck.googlecode.com).


6. ISSUE REPORTING
==================

Namecheck has been tested with gcc 4.6 and 4.7 in Ubuntu-based distros.
Please report any issue in the tracker: https://code.google.com/p/namecheck/issues/list

7. CONTRIBUTE
=============

Please help us by submitting issues, contributing with installation scripts
for other Linux distros, or by translating namecheck to other languages.
(Currently, namecheck is provided in English and Spanish).
